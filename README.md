# Antonio-Alteracoes
Small SPA project developed in HTML, CSS and vanilla JS during the final morning of the <A/C> bootcamp. The goal was to make an SPA based of one of António Variações songs, in our case was "Sempre Ausente".    
This project was developed by a team of 6 and allowed us to apply part of our knowledge of HTML, DOM and JQuery, CSS and JavaScript. 

## Description
Small app that presents to the user an outfit to wear and a location for a night out based of an inquiry that relates to the lyrics of the song.  
We first tried to make a game using the canvas HTML element, but due to time restraints it wasn´t possible.    
This project is more of a gag and not to be taken very seryously, since it was our last project together.  

## Project Status
Finished.
